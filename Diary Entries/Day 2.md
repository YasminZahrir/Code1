### HTML:

HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript (JS).

A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. Within a text file such as an HTML file, elements are **marked up** using tags which explain the purpose of that part of the content.

### Syntax/Semantics:

Syntax is the structure of language. Elements of syntax include word order and sentence structure, which can help reveal the function of an unknown word. Semantics is the meaning of individual words. If one word is unknown, the meanings of surrounding words can give clues to the word's probable meaning.
